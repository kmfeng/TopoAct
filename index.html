      Deep neural networks such as GoogLeNet and ResNet have achieved superhuman performance in tasks like image
      classification.
      To understand how such superior performance is achieved, we can probe a trained deep neural network by studying
      neuron activations, that is, combinations of neuron firings, at any layer of the network in response to a
      particular
      input.
      With a large set of input images, we aim to obtain a global view of what neurons detect by studying their
      activations.
      We ask the following questions: What is the shape of the activation space?
      That is, what is the organizational principle behind neuron activations, and how are the activations related
      within
      a layer and across layers?
      Using tools from topological data analysis, we present <b>TopoAct</b>, a visual exploration system used to study
      topological summaries of activation vectors for a single layer as well as the evolution of such summaries across
      multiple layers.
      We present visual exploration scenarios using <b>TopoAct</b> that provide valuable insights towards learned
      representations of an image classifier.
